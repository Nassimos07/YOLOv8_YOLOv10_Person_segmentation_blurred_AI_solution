In today's digital age, protecting privacy and complying with copyright policies in visual content is more important than ever. That's why I've developed an AI-powered tool designed to automatically blur non-essential regions in images and videos, ensuring that only the person of interest remains clear.

## Key Features
- Seamless integration into video editing platforms.
- Customizable blurring level, segmentation level, and gradient transition.
- Dynamic blurring for moving or stationary subjects.

## Technology Stack
- Ultralytics YOLOv8_segment for precise instance segmentation.
- OpenCV for advanced image processing tasks.

## Applications
This tool has immense potential in video editing, content creation, and beyond. It is ideal for content creators, legal teams, and individuals who need to protect privacy while maintaining content quality.
